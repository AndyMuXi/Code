Wall Street deepens global equity losses as rich valuations bite美国股市大幅下跌 - FT中文网
US stocks were sharply lower in midday on Tuesday, deepening a global sell-off as investors worry that a long winning streak has pushed valuations too far.
Wall Street was on track for its largest two-day loss in more than five months, with highflying healthcare stocks leading the decline, following steep falls in Asia and Europe earlier in the trading day.
Sovereign bond prices came under further pressure, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond approaching 3 per cent for the first time since May.
Falling US Treasury prices precedes the Federal Reserve’s latest policy statement and the Treasury Department’s quarterly refunding announcement, which are both set for release on Wednesday. Investors have already started to anticipate a more hawkish US central bank, with odds that the Fed lifts rates by four quarter-point hikes this year rising rapidly over the past two weeks.
“Certainly there is fear over rising inflation and the effect it is having on the bond market. That is the easy bit,” said Nicholas Colas, co founder of DataTrek. “The hard bit is valuation — it leaves the market exposed to exactly what we are seeing today.”
Investors are also wary ahead of earnings reports from the largest publicly traded US companies, including Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet, later this week.
美国股市周二大幅下跌，加剧了全球股市抛售。投资者担心近期连续上涨已使估值达到过高水平。
华尔街录得5个多月来最大两日跌幅，领跌的是最近一路飙升的医疗保健板块。当日早些时候亚洲股市和欧洲股市也出现大跌。
主权债券价格进一步承压，30年期美国国债收益率自去年5月以来首次逼近3%。
美国国债价格下跌后，美联储(Fed)最新政策声明和美国财政部季度再融资声明都将于周三发布。投资者已开始预期美国央行将采取更为鹰派的政策，在过去两周里，对美联储今年加息4次、每次四分之一点的下注大幅攀升。
“人们肯定对通胀上扬及其对债市的影响感到担忧。这是容易评估的因素，”DataTrek公司联合创始人尼古拉斯•科拉斯(Nicholas Colas)说，“不容易评估的是估值——它让市场容易发生我们今天所看到的情况。”
本周晚些时候，苹果(Apple)、Facebook、亚马逊(Amazon)和谷歌(Google)母公司Alphabet等美国各大上市公司将发布盈利报告。在那之前，投资者也抱有谨慎为上的心态。
