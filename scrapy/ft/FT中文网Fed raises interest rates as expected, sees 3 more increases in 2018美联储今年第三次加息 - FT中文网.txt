Fed raises interest rates as expected, sees 3 more increases in 2018美联储今年第三次加息 - FT中文网
The Federal Reserve lifted short-term interest rates for a third time this year and predicted more increases to follow in the new year as Janet Yellen prepares to hand over the chair amid robust hiring and surging financial markets.
The US central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee increased the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter point to 1.25-1.5 per cent. Policymakers’ median forecast was for another three quarter-point increases in 2018 and two in 2019, even as they acknowledged inflation is continuing to undershoot their target.
Two policymakers – Charles Evans of Chicago and Neel Kashkari of Minneapolis — dissented against the decision to tighten policy, having previously flagged up concerns about sluggish inflation.
Attention will focus on Ms Yellen’s messages about the 2018 and 2019 policy outlook when she addresses the press at 230pm US eastern time.
美联储(Fed)今年第三次上调了短期利率，并预计在新的一年里还会继续加息。在就业市场招聘强劲、金融市场不断飙升的背景下，珍妮特•耶伦(Janet Yellen)准备届满离任。
这家美国央行的联邦公开市场委员会(Federal Open Market Committee，FOMC)将联邦基金利率目标区间提高25个基点，至1.25%-1.5%。政策制定者的预期中值是在2018年再进行三次25个基点的加息，2019年再加息两次，即便他们承认通胀继续低于目标。
两名政策制定者——芝加哥联储行长查尔斯•埃文斯(Charles Evans)和明尼阿波利斯联储行长尼尔•卡什卡利(Neel Kashkari)——不同意收紧政策的决定，他们此前已对通胀疲弱表示担忧。
当耶伦在美国东部时间下午2时30分向新闻界发表讲话的时候，关注焦点将是她对2018年和2019年政策前景的表述。
