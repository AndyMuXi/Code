Widow of Steve Jobs eyes stake in BuzzFeed乔布斯遗孀酝酿投资BuzzFeed - FT中文网
The editor of BuzzFeed has had discussions with the company started by Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of the late Steve Jobs, about investing in the digital media company’s news division, according to two people with knowledge of the talks.Discussions between Ms Powell Jobs’ company, theEmerson Collective, which last year took a majority stake inThe Atlantic magazine, and Buzzfeed’s editor, Ben Smith, are at a preliminary stage and people close to the talks cautioned that a deal may not materialise.BuzzFeed, which split its business into separate news and entertainment units 18 months ago, has won plaudits for its news coverage but was recently hit by job cuts in London and New York.Its distributed content model, which relies heavily on social media, has also been hit by recent changes to Facebook
’s news feed algorithm, which has relegated professionally produced content below pictures and other posts shared by friends and families.In November, BuzzFeed announced a reorganisation aimed at lessening its reliance on native advertising distributed over Facebook and increasing other sources of sales, including ecommerce, videos and licensing.
Ms Powell Jobs, whose net worth is estimated at more than $20bn by Forbes, founded the Emerson Collective in 2004. The philanthropic organisation is focused on education, environmental issues, immigration reform and social justice initiatives but has recently begun to build a roster of media investments. In July, it took the majority stake in The Atlantic magazine, with plans to take full ownership in the coming years.
It also owns stakes in Axios, the media company started by Politico’s Jim VandeHei and Mike Allen, and Anonymous Content, the production company behind the Oscar-winning film Spotlight, and backs a number of non-profit journalism organisations including ProPublica and the Marshall Project.
BuzzFeed published in full the controversial dossier on Donald Trump compiled by the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, which contained several unverifiable claims, and this week led the news agenda in the UK with its scoop on a leaked government analysis that predicted the country would be worse off outside the EU under every scenario that had been projected.
BuzzFeed and the Emerson Collective declined to comment. 
据两名知情人士表示，BuzzFeed的主编与乔布斯的遗孀劳伦•鲍威尔•乔布斯(Laurene Powell Jobs)创办的公司探讨了投资这家数字媒体公司的新闻部的可能性。
鲍威尔•乔布斯的公司Emerson Collective与Buzzfeed的主编本•史密斯(Ben Smith)之间的讨论目前还处于初步阶段，接近商谈的人士告诫称，最终未必达成协议。Emerson Collective去年持有了《大西洋月刊》(The Atlantic)的多数股权。
BuzzFeed因其新闻报道而广受赞誉，但最近受到了伦敦和纽约裁员的影响。18个月前，BuzzFeed将其业务拆分为独立的新闻和娱乐部门。
BuzzFeed分布式的内容模型严重依赖于社交媒体，最近受到Facebook新闻推送算法变动的影响。根据最新算法，Facebook把专业制作内容放在朋友和家人分享的图片和其他帖子下面。
去年11月，BuzzFeed宣布进行重组，旨在减少对Facebook上原生广告的依赖，并增加其他销售渠道，包括电子商务、视频和授权许可。
鲍威尔•乔布斯（福布斯(Forbes)估计其净资产超过200亿美元）于2004年创办了Emerson Collective。这家慈善组织专注于教育、环境问题、移民改革和社会公正倡议，但近期开始积累一系列媒体投资。去年7月，Emerson Collective收购了《大西洋月刊》的多数股权，并计划在未来几年全面接手该杂志。
该公司还持有Axios（由Politico的吉姆•范德海(Jim VandeHei)和迈克•艾伦(Mike Allen)创办的媒体公司）和Anonymous Content（奥斯卡得奖影片《聚焦》(Spotlight)的制片公司）的股权，并出资支持了ProPublica和Marshall Project等多家非营利性新闻机构。
BuzzFeed曾全文公布由英国前情报官员克里斯托弗•斯蒂尔(Christopher Steele)汇编的有关唐纳德•特朗普(Donald Trump)的有争议档案，其中包含一些无法考证的说法。BuzzFeed本周引领英国的新闻议程，独家报道一份泄露的政府分析，据该项分析预测，在每一种想定情形下，英国在退出欧盟后都会吃亏。
BuzzFeed和Emerson Collective拒绝置评。
